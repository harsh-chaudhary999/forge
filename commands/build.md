description: "Partial slice — isolated worktrees + TDD implementation (GREEN after RED). Invoke forge-worktree-gate and forge-tdd; dev-implementer. Not a substitute for full /forge or for skipping State 4b gates."
---

Invoke **`forge-worktree-gate`**, then drive implementation with **`forge-tdd`** (and **`dev-implementer`** as appropriate): **RED → GREEN → refactor** in **fresh git worktrees** per repo.

This command assumes **approved tech plans** and that **orchestration gates** for the task are satisfied **before** production feature work — see **`agents/dev-implementer.md`** (**`BLOCKED_ORCHESTRATION`** if **`eval/`** is empty, missing **`[P4.0-EVAL-YAML]`**, or missing QA CSV / log when **`product.md`** requires it or the run was full **`/forge`**).

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT ship production feature code that bypasses **`conductor-orchestrate` State 4b** when the task is under **full `/forge`** or when **`forge_qa_csv_before_eval: true`** — implementer must refuse; back up to **`qa-manual-test-cases-from-prd`**, **`eval-translate-english`**, or **`forge-tdd`** RED as needed.
</HARD-GATE>

**Assistant chat:** Follow **`docs/forge-one-step-horizon.md`** and **`skills/using-forge/SKILL.md`** — **one-step horizon**; **question-forward** elicitation (no unsolicited command/skill-reference **preface**, no **later-stage** status **suffix** on single-answer turns, **no defensive downstream-gate narration** mid-elicitation — **`docs/forge-one-step-horizon.md`** **No defensive downstream-gate narration (repo-wide)**); **one blocking affordance per unrelated fork** (no bundled prose obligations); **no dual prompts** — **never** **`AskQuestion`** / **Questions** widget on **one** topic **and** a **long markdown question** on **another** in the **same** message; **phase-specific** waivers/ordering **only** where this doc and the active skill say; **Multi-question elicitation** (items **4–8**) & **Blocking interactive prompts**.

**Forge plugin scope:** Worktrees and brain paths per **`worktree-per-project-per-task`**; this repo’s skills only.

**vs `/forge`:** **`/build`** is execution for **implementation** only. Full pipeline (including State 4b QA CSV first on **`/forge`**): **`commands/forge.md`**.

**Session style:** Prefer **execution-style** (edits, tests, terminals). See **`docs/platforms/session-modes-forge.md`**.

**Product terms:** For **user-visible** strings (UI, errors, emails), read **`~/forge/brain/prds/<task-id>/terminology.md`** when it exists; align copy with **canonical** rows or record **DRIFT** + fix in the task brain per [docs/terminology-review.md](../docs/terminology-review.md) — not [skills/forge-glossary/SKILL.md](../skills/forge-glossary/SKILL.md) (Forge process terms only).
